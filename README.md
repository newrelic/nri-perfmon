# nri-perfmon - Windows Perfmon/WMI On-Host Integration for New Relic Infrastructure

This integration is capable of...
* running WMI queries and collecting their result
* collecting Performance Counters (aka Perfmon Counters)
* running against the local host or a remote host
* reporting the results to New Relic as events, via the Infrastructure Agent

## Links

* **[Download The Latest Release](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-perfmon/releases/latest)**
* **[Library Of Config Files](nri-perfmon/config)** - includes examples for .NET, Active Directory, ASP, BizTalk, Exchange, Hyper-V, MSSQL, Windows Event Logs and more!

## Installation

**NOTE: If you are installing this integration (not building it from scratch), [Download The Latest Release HERE](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-perfmon/releases/latest) instead of cloning this repo!**

### Requirements

* .NET Framework 3.5 or greater (including all 4.x installations)
* New Relic account
* New Relic Infrastructure Agent installed on a Windows server

### Option 1: Installer

1. Unzip nri-perfmon to a temporary location on the host
1. Run Powershell in "Run As Administrator" mode
1. In Powershell, change to the directory where you unzipped nri-perfmon.
1. Run `install-windows.ps1`, which will place the files in their proper locations and restart the Infra Agent.

### Option 2: Manual

1. Unzip nri-perfmon to a temporary location on the host
1. Create `nri-perfmon` under `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\custom-integrations`.
1. Place the following files in `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\custom-integrations\nri-perfmon`:
	* `nri-perfmon.exe`
	* `nri-perfmon.exe.config`
	* `config.json`
	* `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`
	* `FluentCommandLineParser.dll`
1. Place `nri-perfmon-definition.yml` in `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\custom-integrations` (ALONGSIDE but NOT IN the `nri-perfmon` folder)
1. Place `nri-perfmon-config.yml` in `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`
1. Restart the Infra Agent

## Usage

Upon installation, nri-perfmon should start reporting to your New Relic account with the default counters defined in `config.json`. The following configurations are to suit advanced usage patterns, i.e. remote polling and custom counters.

### Command-line Arguments

If run at command line without anything, the executable should report JSON results from WMI queries specified in `config.json` to stdout, and any error messages to stderr. This is useful for testing and debugging your counter/query configuration.

* `-c | --configFile [file]`: Config file to use (default: `config.json`)
* `-i | --pollInt [nnn]`: Frequency of polling (ms) (default: 10000ms, ignored if less than 10000ms)
* `-n | --compName [name]`: Name of computer that you want to poll (default: local host)
* `-r | --runOnce [true|false]`: Run this integration once and exit, instead of polling (default: false)
* `-g | --ignoreInfoLogs [true|false]`: Ignores logs of log type Info (default: false)
* `-v | --verbose [true|false]`: [Verbose Logging Mode](#verbose-logging-mode) (default: false)

#### Verbose Logging Mode

Verbose Logging Mode is meant for testing your [Counters](#counters) and seeing if and how they will appear in NRDB. With Verbose Logging Mode enabled, the following occurs:
* All log messages are written to stderr
* Metrics are pretty-printed to stderr
* No messages will appear in Event Logs
* No metrics are written to stdout
* **NRDB will not show any data from this Integration when running it in Verbose Logging Mode.**

Because stderr messages arent picked up by the NRI Agent in Windows, it is best to use this mode at command line, like so:
```batch
C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\custom-integrations> nri-perfmon\nri-perfmon.exe -v -c C:\path\to\custom_config.json
```

### Configuration Within Infrastructure Agent

To use any of the [Command-Line Arguments listed above](#command-line-arguments), edit `nri-perfmon-definition.yml` and add them as argument lines, like so:

```yaml
#
# New Relic Infrastructure Perfmon Integration
#
name: com.newrelic.perfmon
description: Perfmon On-Host Integration
protocol_version: 1
os: windows
commands:
  metrics:
    command:
      - .\nri-perfmon\nri-perfmon.exe
      - -i
      - 60000
      - -c
      - custom_config.json
      - -n
      - MyCompName
    prefix: integration/nri-perfmon
    interval: 15
```

Note:
The `interval:` field at the bottom does need to be there with a number, but it does not change the polling interval. To do that, add `-i` and `<interval_(ms)>` as consecutive lines to your `command` arguments.

### Counters

* Out-of-the-box, we have collected a set of Perfmon counters that pertain to .NET applications. 
* We have a library of pre-built config files that you can use, **[found here.](nri-perfmon/config)** Contributions to this library by way of Pull Request are welcome!
* If you would like to collect your own counters, customize the `counterlist` in `config.json`, or create your own config file and use `-c your_config_file.json` at execution.

#### `config.json` Format

```json
{
  "counterlist": [{
      "provider": "provider_name|PerfCounter",
      "category": "category_name",
      "instance": "(optional) instance_name",
      "counters": [{
          "counter": "*|counter_name"
        },
        {
          "counter": "another_counter_name"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "eventname": "(optional, default: 'WMIQueryResult') insights_event_name",
      "query": "the_whole_WMI_Query",
      "querynamespace": "(optional, default: 'root//cimv2') query_namespace",
      "querytype": "(optional, default: 'wmi_query') wmi_query|wmi_eventlistener",
      "counters": [{
          "counter": "counter_name|counter_class.counter_name",
          "attrname": "(optional) attribute_name_in_insights_event",
          "parser": "regex_to_parse_attribute_value"
        },
        {
          "counter": "another_counter_name"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Simple Queries

_**For a walkthrough of creating a Simple Query, please see [TIPS.md](TIPS.md).**_

* The "`provider`, `category`, (optional) `instance`" form of the counter is for building simple queries, with the following limitations:
  * Uses the default namespace (`root/cimv2`)
  * Limited to Select statements against classes with the name `Win32_PerfFormattedData_{provider}_{category}`
  * No custom names for individual attributes
  * Uses the category name as the Insights event type.
* The `instance` property is optional and should *only* be used if you want to show a specific instance.
  * If left out, all instances will be polled automatically.
  * If there are multiple instances returned by the counter|query, each instance name will appear in the `name` attribute of the event.
* You must have at least one `counter` specified in `counters`. You can use wildcard ('\*') as the value to get all counters for that class.

Example of usage:
```json
{
  "provider": "ASPNET",
  "category": "ASPNETApplications",
  "counters": [
    {
      "counter": "RequestsTotal"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Performance Counters

If you specify the `provider` as `PerfCounter`, it will retrieve the Windows Performance Counter instead of running a WMI query. This can be useful if WMI is returning "all 0's" in a query or the appropriate Performance Counter is easier to find [Click here for a good how-to on using Performance Monitor.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Ask-The-Performance-Team/Windows-Performance-Monitor-Overview/ba-p/375481)

* No custom names for individual attributes
* Uses the category name as the Insights event type.
* The `instance` property is optional and should *only* be used if you want to show a specific instance.
  * If left out, all instances will be polled automatically.
  * If there are multiple instances returned by the counter|query, each instance name will appear in the `name` attribute of the event.
* You must have at least one `counter` specified in `counters`. You can use wildcard ('\*') as the value to get all counters for that class.

Example of usage:
```json
{
  "provider": "PerfCounter",
  "category": "ASP.NET Apps v4.0.30319",
  "counters": [
    {
      "counter": "Requests Total"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Complex Queries & Event Listeners

* `eventname` (optional) - The event name you wish to create in Insights with the results of your query.
* `query` - The WMI query to be run.
* `querytype` (optional) - only used to run an event listener instead of a typical WMI Query (set to `wmi_eventlistener`)
	* This listener will operate as a separate thread, so that it doesn't impede other queries from running.
* `querynamespace` (optional) - allows you to access any WMI namespace.
	* If set, this query will operate as a separate thread, so that it doesn't impede other queries that use the default namespace.
	* Any escape characters (`\`) must be doubled (`\\`)
* `eventtype` (optional) - set that query's result events in Insights to anything specified here.
* `counters` (optional) - used to specify counters to extract from the query, and transformations to perform on them.
	* If not performing any transformations, you can specify counters in the query itself (i.e. "`Select Name, Description, DeviceID from Win32_PNPEntity`) and out this section.
	* Multiple `counters` entries *can* be against the same counter (see example below).
		* They will need to write to different attributes, otherwise they will overwrite one another.
	* `counter` - the counter name you want to extract/match. Must be exact.
	* `attrname` (optional) - use to rename the counter.
		* If used, that counter name will be renamed in the Insights event to the value set here.
		* If left out, the attribute in Insights will be named with the original name of that counter.
	* `parser` (optional) - use a regular expression to parse an attribute value.
		* It can only be used on Strings. It will be ignored for all other counter types.
		* Any escape characters (`\`) must be doubled (`\\`)
		* If used, the counter value will be matched against the regular expression provided here.
		* If it doesn't match, the original value of the counter will be returned.
		* If it matches and you used groups, the result will be a concatenized string of all of the groups.
		* If it matches and you didn't use groups, the result will be the portion of the string that matched.

Example of usage:
```json
{
	"eventname": "HyperV_GuestNetworkAdapter",
	"query": "SELECT InstanceId, DHCPEnabled, DNSServers, IPAddresses FROM Msvm_GuestNetworkAdapterConfiguration",
	"querynamespace": "ROOT\\virtualization\\v2",
	"counters": [{
			"counter": "InstanceId",
			"attrname": "Name",
			"parser": "Microsoft:GuestNetwork\\\\([0-9A-F-]+)\\\\[0-9A-F-]+"
		},
		{
			"counter": "InstanceId",
			"attrname": "AdapterId",
			"parser": "Microsoft:GuestNetwork\\\\[0-9A-F-]+\\\\([0-9A-F-]+)"
		},
		{ "counter": "DHCPEnabled" },
		{ "counter": "DNSServers" },
		{
			"counter": "IPAddresses",
			"attrName": "IPAddress",
			"parser": "([0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3})"
		},
		{ "counter": "IPAddresses" }
	]
},
```

Notes:
* To retrieve properties from within a counter object, use the format `counter.property`, i.e. `targetInstance.DeviceID`
* If there are multiple instances returned by the counter|query, each instance name will appear in the `name` attribute of the event.
